    "text": "This visualization illustrates the strategic evolution of NHL offenses over the last two decades, highlighting a clear shift from volume-based shooting to efficiency-based shot selection. As advanced analytics became prominent in front offices, teams began to discourage low-probability attempts from the perimeter, opting instead to hold possession longer to generate high-danger chances. The chart reveals a distinct trajectory: earlier seasons (in darker colors) cluster towards the bottom-right, indicating high shot volume but low quality, while modern seasons (in brighter colors) have moved towards the top-left, characterized by slightly fewer shots per game but a significantly higher Average Expected Goals (xG) per shot. This data was sourced from MoneyPuck.com, which provides comprehensive advanced metrics for every NHL shot recorded since 2007."
